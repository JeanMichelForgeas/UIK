   Subject : Display Database inquiries

   Well, I had not long ago to check in the graphics.library display
database, to get informations about the display modes available in
the system (I was working on a Prefs/ScreenMode-like application).
   As far as I could see, I could only get information for what I'll
name the basic display modes, that is when I got informations for a
'PAL:low res' mode, the PropertyFlags of this mode didn't reflect
the capability to set this mode in HAM, neither in EHB.
   The modes I checked were the ones whose ID was given by the
NextDisplayInfo() function, and then getting the DIHandle associated
with them, if it exists.
   The only way I found to know if a mode could be set in either HAM
or EHB, was to add the HAM_ or EXTRAHALFBRITE_ key to the DisplayID
I was checking, and do a ModeNotAvailable() with the new ID I got.
I guess this could work with further revisions of the OS, since I only
use the bits in the MODE_KEY word, but it is said in the RKM that we
shouldn't interpret the bits of the IDs directly. It's maybe subtle,
but I also guess that the way I did my checking is a sort of direct
interpretation.
   It is correct that the PropertyFlags, who are supposed to reflect
a mode's potential properties (as the other informations such as
MaxDepth), are not set properly, in my opinion, for HAM or EHB at
least ?
   Best regards.
